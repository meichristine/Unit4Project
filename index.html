                    You are Bed Sad.
                    <br>You either
                    <br>1. Typically like your alone time and in a way may be comforted by chilling in bed, using technoloy to distract yourself from whatever made you sad.
                    <br>2. Like your alone time, but you choose to rot in bed and keep yourself in the wrong state of mind.

                    You are Public Sad.
                    <br>You either
                    <br>1. Likely like to express your feelings to others, but when you do, it probably makes you feel more miserable because the adivce you're given you'll take in the negative context.
                    <br>2. Express your feelings to others, and you end up feeling better about it all because it just helps you let it go.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>
                    You are Quiet Sad.
                    <br>You either
                    <br>1. Don't express your feelings to others because you might think it's a waste of time (it's not), and you keep yourself stuck in your head and stay emo.
                    <br>2. Don't talk about your feelings because you think it's just easier to kind of forget it and feel better, but it's still there in the back of your mind, but not too extreme.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You are Thug It Out Sad.
                    <br>You either
                    <br>1. Let the bad get to you, but pretend you're okay because you don't want to affect others, but you still feel horrible.
                    <br>2. Have the "ight" mindset, and you just go through life the best you can, and you eventually just let it go.
